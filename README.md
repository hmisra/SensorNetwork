## Overview

SensorAugmentor is a deep learning framework designed to bridge the gap between low-quality sensor data and high-precision control systems. By implementing a neural teacher-student architecture with residual connections, it:

1. **Enhances Signal Quality** - Transforms low-quality (LQ) sensor readings into high-quality (HQ) reconstructions
2. **Improves Latent Representations** - Creates refined embeddings optimized for downstream tasks
3. **Enables Precise Actuator Control** - Directly maps enhanced sensor data to optimal control commands

This capability has profound implications across multiple industries where sensor reliability, cost, and control precision create engineering trade-offs.

2. Encode HQ sensor data → latent_hq
3. Reconstruct HQ signal from latent_lq
4. Predict actuator command from latent_lq
5. Align latent_lq with latent_hq (teacher-student)
6. Update network to minimize combined loss

INFERENCE:

### Training Your Own Model

```bash
# Run with default parameters
python sensor_actuator_network.py

# For GPU acceleration (automatic if available)
# The code detects CUDA availability and uses it when present

## Customization Guide

### Custom Sensor Types

Adapt the system for your specific sensor array by modifying:
1. `sensor_dim` to match your sensor's dimensionality
2. `SyntheticSensorDataset` with your real data loader
3. Loss weightings to emphasize reconstruction vs. control accuracy

### Alternative Network Architectures

The modular design allows replacing components:
- Swap linear layers for convolutional ones for spatial sensors
- Replace ReLU with alternative activations (GELU, Swish) 
- Add recurrent layers (LSTM, GRU) for temporal sensor processing
