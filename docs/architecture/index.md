## Design Philosophy

The SensorAugmentor framework was built on several key design principles:

1. **Signal Enhancement through Deep Learning**: Leveraging neural networks to enhance low-quality sensor data by learning the mapping to high-quality signals.

2. **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Simultaneously optimizing for signal reconstruction and actuator command prediction through shared latent representations.

3. **Modularity and Extensibility**: Component-based design allowing users to replace or extend specific parts without affecting the entire system.

4. **Minimalism**: Preferring simple, focused components that do one thing well over complex, monolithic implementations.

5. **Production Readiness**: Designed with real-world deployment scenarios in mind, including serialization, testing, and performance optimization.

## System Architecture

The SensorAugmentor framework consists of the following high-level layers:

1. **Data Layer**: Handles data loading, preprocessing, augmentation, and batching.
2. **Model Layer**: Implements the neural network architecture for signal processing.
3. **Training Layer**: Manages the training process, optimization, and evaluation.
4. **Serialization Layer**: Handles model saving, loading, and versioning.
5. **Deployment Layer**: Facilitates model deployment in various environments.

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture:

## Core Components

### ResidualBlock

The `ResidualBlock` is a fundamental building block that implements skip connections to help with gradient flow during training and enable deeper networks:

```python
class ResidualBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim):
        super(ResidualBlock, self).__init__()
        self.block = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(dim, dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(dim, dim)
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return x + self.block(x)
```

Key features:
- Simple yet effective design with two linear layers and a ReLU activation
- Skip connection that adds input directly to the output
- Preserves input dimension, making it easy to stack multiple blocks

### SensorAugmentor

The `SensorAugmentor` class is the main model that implements the sensor data enhancement and actuator command prediction:

```python
class SensorAugmentor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, sensor_dim, hidden_dim=64, output_dim=None, num_resblocks=2):
        super(SensorAugmentor, self).__init__()
        self.sensor_dim = sensor_dim
        self.hidden_dim = hidden_dim
        self.output_dim = output_dim if output_dim is not None else sensor_dim
        
        # Encoder (Low-quality sensor to latent space)
        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(sensor_dim, hidden_dim),
            nn.ReLU()
        )
        
        # Post-encoding residual blocks
        self.post_encoding_resblock = self._build_resblocks(hidden_dim, num_resblocks)
        
        # High-quality signal reconstructor
        self.hq_reconstructor = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, sensor_dim)
        
        # Actuator command head (if output_dim is provided)
        self.actuator_head = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, self.output_dim)
        
    def _build_resblocks(self, dim, num_blocks):
        blocks = []
        for _ in range(num_blocks):
            blocks.append(ResidualBlock(dim))
        return nn.Sequential(*blocks)
        
    def forward(self, x_lq, x_hq=None):
        # Encode low-quality input
        encoded_lq = self.encoder(x_lq)
        encoded_lq = self.post_encoding_resblock(encoded_lq)
        
        # Reconstruct high-quality signal
        reconstructed_hq = self.hq_reconstructor(encoded_lq)
        
        # Generate actuator command
        actuator_command = self.actuator_head(encoded_lq)
        
        # Encode high-quality signal if provided (for training)
        encoded_hq = None
        if x_hq is not None:
            encoded_hq = self.encoder(x_hq)
            encoded_hq = self.post_encoding_resblock(encoded_hq)
        
        return reconstructed_hq, actuator_command, encoded_lq, encoded_hq
```

Key features:
- Encoder that maps sensor data to a latent representation
- ResidualBlocks for improved gradient flow
- Separate heads for reconstructing high-quality signals and predicting actuator commands
- Optional encoding of high-quality signals for training purposes

### SyntheticSensorDataset

The `SyntheticSensorDataset` class provides synthetic data generation for training and testing:

```python
class SyntheticSensorDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, num_samples=1000, sensor_dim=10, output_dim=None, noise_level=0.2, seed=None):
        self.num_samples = num_samples
        self.sensor_dim = sensor_dim
        self.output_dim = output_dim if output_dim is not None else sensor_dim
        self.noise_level = noise_level
        
        if seed is not None:
            torch.manual_seed(seed)
            np.random.seed(seed)
        
        # Generate "high-quality" sensor data (ground truth)
        self.x_hq = torch.randn(num_samples, sensor_dim)
        
        # Generate "low-quality" sensor data (noisy version)
        self.x_lq = self.x_hq + noise_level * torch.randn(num_samples, sensor_dim)
        
        # Generate "actuator commands" (simulated relationship)
        self.y_cmd = torch.sin(self.x_hq[:, 0:1]) + torch.cos(self.x_hq[:, 1:2])
        if self.output_dim > 1:
            # Add more simulated relationships for multi-dimensional output
            extra_dims = torch.zeros(num_samples, self.output_dim - 1)
            for i in range(1, self.output_dim):
                if i < sensor_dim:
                    extra_dims[:, i-1] = torch.tanh(self.x_hq[:, i])
            self.y_cmd = torch.cat([self.y_cmd, extra_dims], dim=1)
    
    def __len__(self):
        return self.num_samples
    
    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.x_lq[idx], self.x_hq[idx], self.y_cmd[idx]
```

Key features:
- Customizable number of samples, dimensions, and noise levels
- Deterministic generation using optional seed for reproducibility
- Synthetic relationships between high-quality signals and actuator commands

### EarlyStopper

The `EarlyStopper` class implements early stopping to prevent overfitting:

```python
class EarlyStopper:
    def __init__(self, patience=5, min_delta=0):
        self.patience = patience
        self.min_delta = min_delta
        self.counter = 0
        self.min_val_loss = float('inf')
        
    def early_stop(self, val_loss):
        if val_loss < self.min_val_loss - self.min_delta:
            self.min_val_loss = val_loss
            self.counter = 0
        else:
            self.counter += 1
            if self.counter >= self.patience:
                return True
        return False
```

Key features:
- Configurable patience and minimum improvement threshold
- Simple interface for tracking validation loss
- Automatic determination of when to stop training

## Data Flow

The SensorAugmentor framework processes data through the following flow:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Raw sensor data is loaded and parsed.
2. **Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned, normalized, and prepared for model input.
3. **Model Processing**:
   - Low-quality sensor data is encoded into a latent representation.
   - The latent representation is processed through residual blocks.
   - The processed representation is used to reconstruct high-quality signals and predict actuator commands.
4. **Postprocessing**: Model outputs are denormalized and prepared for use.
5. **Feedback Loop**: During training, performance metrics are used to update model parameters.

The following diagram illustrates the data flow during training:

## Model Architecture

The SensorAugmentor model architecture is based on a shared encoder with multiple output heads. This design allows the model to learn a common latent representation that captures important features of the sensor data, which can then be used for multiple tasks.

### Encoder Design

The encoder consists of:
1. An initial linear layer that projects the input sensor data into a higher-dimensional latent space
2. A non-linear activation function (ReLU) to introduce non-linearity
3. A series of residual blocks to process the latent representation further

The encoder learns to map noisy, low-quality sensor data to a cleaner, more informative latent representation. By training on pairs of low-quality and high-quality data, the encoder learns to extract meaningful features from noisy inputs.

### Residual Blocks

Residual blocks are key to the model's performance, allowing for deeper networks without the vanishing gradient problem. Each block includes:
1. A skip connection that preserves the input
2. A non-linear transformation path with two linear layers and a ReLU activation
3. An additive combination of the skip connection and transformed path

The residual connections help gradient flow during backpropagation, enabling more effective training of deeper networks.

### Output Heads

The model has two output heads:
1. **HQ Reconstructor**: Reconstructs high-quality sensor signals from the latent representation
2. **Actuator Head**: Predicts actuator commands from the same latent representation

This multi-task design forces the model to learn a general, informative latent representation that captures relevant features for both tasks.

### Loss Function

The training uses a composite loss function that combines:
1. **Reconstruction Loss**: Mean squared error between reconstructed and true high-quality signals
2. **Encoding Loss**: Mean squared error between encodings of low-quality and high-quality signals
3. **Actuator Loss**: Mean squared error between predicted and true actuator commands

```python
def calculate_loss(reconstructed_hq, act_command, encoded_lq, encoded_hq, x_hq, y_cmd):
    loss_recon = F.mse_loss(reconstructed_hq, x_hq)
    loss_encoding = F.mse_loss(encoded_lq, encoded_hq)
    loss_act = F.mse_loss(act_command, y_cmd)
    
    # Combined loss with weights
    total_loss = loss_recon + 0.1 * loss_encoding + 0.5 * loss_act
    
    return total_loss, loss_recon, loss_encoding, loss_act
```

The weights for each component of the loss can be adjusted based on the specific use case.

## Training Pipeline

The training pipeline consists of several key components:

### Data Preparation

1. **Dataset Creation**: Create or load datasets for training and validation
2. **Data Loaders**: Create PyTorch data loaders for efficient batching and shuffling
3. **Normalization**: Apply normalization to standardize input data

### Training Loop

The core training loop:

```python
def train_model(model, train_loader, val_loader, num_epochs=100, lr=1e-3, patience=5):
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=lr)
    early_stopper = EarlyStopper(patience=patience)
    
    train_losses = []
    val_losses = []
    
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        # Training phase
        model.train()
        train_loss = 0.0
        
        for x_lq, x_hq, y_cmd in train_loader:
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            
            # Forward pass
            reconstructed_hq, act_command, encoded_lq, encoded_hq = model(x_lq, x_hq)
            
            # Calculate loss
            loss, _, _, _ = calculate_loss(reconstructed_hq, act_command, encoded_lq, encoded_hq, x_hq, y_cmd)
            
            # Backward pass and optimize
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            
            train_loss += loss.item()
        
        train_loss /= len(train_loader)
        train_losses.append(train_loss)
        
        # Validation phase
        model.eval()
        val_loss = 0.0
        
        with torch.no_grad():
            for x_lq, x_hq, y_cmd in val_loader:
                reconstructed_hq, act_command, encoded_lq, encoded_hq = model(x_lq, x_hq)
                loss, _, _, _ = calculate_loss(reconstructed_hq, act_command, encoded_lq, encoded_hq, x_hq, y_cmd)
                val_loss += loss.item()
        
        val_loss /= len(val_loader)
        val_losses.append(val_loss)
        
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}, Train Loss: {train_loss:.4f}, Val Loss: {val_loss:.4f}")
        
        # Early stopping
        if early_stopper.early_stop(val_loss):
            print(f"Early stopping at epoch {epoch+1}")
            break
    
    return train_losses, val_losses
```

### Model Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on test data to measure:
1. **Signal Reconstruction Quality**: How well the model reconstructs high-quality signals
2. **Actuator Command Accuracy**: How accurately the model predicts actuator commands
3. **Latent Space Quality**: How informative and structured the learned latent space is

## Extension Points

The SensorAugmentor framework is designed to be modular and extensible. Key extension points include:

### Custom Encoders

Users can replace the default encoder with custom architectures:

```python
class CNNEncoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, sensor_dim, hidden_dim):
        super(CNNEncoder, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv1d(1, 16, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv1d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool1d(2)
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(32 * (sensor_dim // 2), hidden_dim)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # Reshape for 1D convolution [batch, 1, sensor_dim]
        x = x.unsqueeze(1)
        x = self.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = self.pool(x)
        x = self.relu(self.conv2(x))
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.relu(self.fc(x))
        return x

# Create custom SensorAugmentor with CNN encoder
class CNNSensorAugmentor(SensorAugmentor):
    def __init__(self, sensor_dim, hidden_dim=64, output_dim=None, num_resblocks=2):
        super(CNNSensorAugmentor, self).__init__(sensor_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim, num_resblocks)
        # Replace the default encoder with CNN encoder
        self.encoder = CNNEncoder(sensor_dim, hidden_dim)
```

### Custom Residual Blocks

Users can implement alternative residual block designs:

```python
class GatedResidualBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim):
        super(GatedResidualBlock, self).__init__()
        self.block = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(dim, dim),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(dim, dim)
        )
        self.gate = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(dim, dim),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        block_output = self.block(x)
        gate_output = self.gate(x)
        return x + gate_output * block_output
```

### Custom Loss Functions

Users can define custom loss functions for specific applications:

```python
def custom_loss(reconstructed_hq, act_command, encoded_lq, encoded_hq, x_hq, y_cmd):
    # Standard losses
    loss_recon = F.mse_loss(reconstructed_hq, x_hq)
    loss_encoding = F.mse_loss(encoded_lq, encoded_hq)
    loss_act = F.mse_loss(act_command, y_cmd)
    
    # Add custom frequency-domain loss for sensor data
    freq_recon = torch.rfft(reconstructed_hq, 1)
    freq_hq = torch.rfft(x_hq, 1)
    loss_freq = F.mse_loss(freq_recon, freq_hq)
    
    # Combined loss with weights
    total_loss = loss_recon + 0.1 * loss_encoding + 0.5 * loss_act + 0.3 * loss_freq
    
    return total_loss
```

## Performance Considerations

Several optimizations improve the performance of SensorAugmentor:

### Computational Efficiency

1. **Batch Processing**: All operations support batch processing for efficient parallel computation
2. **Minimal Architecture**: The base model uses a minimal number of layers to reduce computation
3. **Shared Encoder**: Using a shared encoder for both tasks reduces computational overhead

### Memory Efficiency

1. **Parameter Sharing**: Shared encoder reduces the total number of parameters
2. **Residual Connections**: Allow deeper networks with fewer total parameters
3. **Linear Layers**: Using linear layers instead of convolutional layers for the base model reduces memory requirements

### Training Efficiency

1. **Early Stopping**: Prevents unnecessary training iterations
2. **Composite Loss**: Multi-objective loss function allows simultaneous optimization of all tasks
3. **Residual Connections**: Improve gradient flow for faster convergence
