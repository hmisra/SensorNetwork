# Multi-Agent Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
The SensorAugmentor project is a deep learning framework designed to enhance low-quality sensor data into high-quality signals and generate corresponding actuator control commands. The goal is to improve the framework to make it more robust, versatile, and production-ready.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
After reviewing the codebase, several areas of improvement have been identified:
1. Limited model architectures (currently only using fully connected networks with residual blocks)
2. No formal model serialization and loading workflow
3. Lack of comprehensive testing and evaluation metrics
4. No API or service layer for production deployment
5. Limited support for different types of sensor data (e.g., image, time-series)
6. No hyperparameter tuning capabilities
7. Basic visualization without interactive capabilities
8. No data augmentation strategies for improved robustness
9. No uncertainty quantification in predictions
10. Limited documentation and usage examples

## Verifiable Success Criteria
The improvements should result in:
1. Enhanced model performance on different sensor types
2. Better code maintainability and organization
3. Improved documentation and user experience
4. Production-ready deployment options
5. More comprehensive testing and evaluation capabilities

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. Architectural enhancements to the model
2. Data handling and processing improvements
3. Training pipeline enhancements
4. Deployment and production readiness
5. Testing, evaluation, and documentation
